Hello World!

This is my first posting to my own 'thegrid.io' ever since I got the "green light" to use it as my own. 

So ... \[long pause\] ... now that I have it, what am I going to do with it? 

Make the world a better place? 

Can I make the world a better place by writing things on to my own 'thegrid.io' site? 

Really? 

Before I continue, is the world now not better? Or is it worse? 

Or is it neither? 

What if the world is not better, nor worse. The world is just as it should be. 

WORLDLY. 

The world is not better, nor worse, nor good, nor bad, nor whatever.

The world is just WORLDLY. 

Hello, WORLDLY world.
